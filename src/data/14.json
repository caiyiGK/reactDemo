Totally inspired by this pivotal moment in music history, he and his friends set up a record label, Factory Records, signing first Joy Division (who go on to become New Order) then James and the Happy Mondays, who all become seminal artists of their time. What ensues is a tale of music, sex, drugs, larger-than-life characters, and the birth of one of the most famous dance clubs in the world, The Hacienda - a mecca for clubbers as famous as the likes of Studio 54. Graphically depicting the music and dance heritage of Manchester from the late 70's to the early 90's, this comedy documents the vibrancy that made Mad-chester the place in the world that you would most like to be.","rating":"6.4","year":"2002","tagline":"Share the Ecstacy!","thumb":"/library/metadata/17689/thumb/1463684676","art":"/library/metadata/17689/art/1463684676","duration":"7019776","originallyAvailableAt":"2002-02-13","addedAt":"1463684621","updatedAt":"1463684676","chapterSource":"media","primaryExtraKey":"/library/metadata/17691"},"Media":{"@attributes":{"videoResolution":"720","id":"38571","duration":"7019776","bitrate":"4088","width":"1280","height":"694","aspectRatio":"1.85","audioChannels":"2","audioCodec":"aac","videoCodec":"h264","container":"mkv","videoFrameRate":"24p","audioProfile":"lc","videoProfile":"high"},"Part":{"@attributes":{"id":"40856","key":"/library/parts/40856/1463603948/file.mkv","duration":"7019776","file":"/volumeUSB5/usbshare/DOC-MOVIE-DOCK01-V03/24.Hour.Party.People (2002)/24.Hour.Party.People (2002) 720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT.mkv","size":"3587224202","audioProfile":"lc","container":"mkv","deepAnalysisVersion":"1","hasThumbnail":"1","requiredBandwidths":"6706,6411,6003,6003,6003,6003,6003,6003","videoProfile":"high"}}},"Genre":[{"@attributes":{"tag":"Comedy"}},{"@attributes":{"tag":"Drama"}}],"Director":{"@attributes":{"tag":"Michael Winterbottom"}},"Writer":{"@attributes":{"tag":"Frank Cottrell Boyce"}},"Country":{"@attributes":{"tag":"United Kingdom"}},"Role":[{"@attributes":{"tag":"Steve Coogan"}},{"@attributes":{"tag":"John Thomson"}},{"@attributes":{"tag":"Lennie James"}}]},{"@attributes":{"ratingKey":"21124","key":"/library/metadata/21124","type":"movie","title":"Ai Weiwei: The Fake Case","summary":"After 81 days of solitary detention world famous Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is put under house arrest.
